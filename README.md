# DumpFilemanager
Winodws C++ automatically intercept and generate crash files without the need for Windbg

## There are two ways to use it:
1. Build the project with CMake and view the demo to understand its usage.
2. Simply add the **DumpFileManager.h** and **DumpFileManager.cpp** files to your project, then include **DumpFileManager.h** in your project, and finally call **startDetectCrash()** at program startup.
